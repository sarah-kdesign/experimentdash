  "hypothesis": "We believe that many users are not completing the most valuable actions they can first because there are too many call to actions and prompts throughout the product that are not intended for new signups. \n\nIf we reduce prompts driving users to billing configuration, new users will be more likely to take actions that will add the most value for them and go on to have success.\n\nThis experiment targets users who have billing alerts and within a 1 day grace period of completing their account set up.",
