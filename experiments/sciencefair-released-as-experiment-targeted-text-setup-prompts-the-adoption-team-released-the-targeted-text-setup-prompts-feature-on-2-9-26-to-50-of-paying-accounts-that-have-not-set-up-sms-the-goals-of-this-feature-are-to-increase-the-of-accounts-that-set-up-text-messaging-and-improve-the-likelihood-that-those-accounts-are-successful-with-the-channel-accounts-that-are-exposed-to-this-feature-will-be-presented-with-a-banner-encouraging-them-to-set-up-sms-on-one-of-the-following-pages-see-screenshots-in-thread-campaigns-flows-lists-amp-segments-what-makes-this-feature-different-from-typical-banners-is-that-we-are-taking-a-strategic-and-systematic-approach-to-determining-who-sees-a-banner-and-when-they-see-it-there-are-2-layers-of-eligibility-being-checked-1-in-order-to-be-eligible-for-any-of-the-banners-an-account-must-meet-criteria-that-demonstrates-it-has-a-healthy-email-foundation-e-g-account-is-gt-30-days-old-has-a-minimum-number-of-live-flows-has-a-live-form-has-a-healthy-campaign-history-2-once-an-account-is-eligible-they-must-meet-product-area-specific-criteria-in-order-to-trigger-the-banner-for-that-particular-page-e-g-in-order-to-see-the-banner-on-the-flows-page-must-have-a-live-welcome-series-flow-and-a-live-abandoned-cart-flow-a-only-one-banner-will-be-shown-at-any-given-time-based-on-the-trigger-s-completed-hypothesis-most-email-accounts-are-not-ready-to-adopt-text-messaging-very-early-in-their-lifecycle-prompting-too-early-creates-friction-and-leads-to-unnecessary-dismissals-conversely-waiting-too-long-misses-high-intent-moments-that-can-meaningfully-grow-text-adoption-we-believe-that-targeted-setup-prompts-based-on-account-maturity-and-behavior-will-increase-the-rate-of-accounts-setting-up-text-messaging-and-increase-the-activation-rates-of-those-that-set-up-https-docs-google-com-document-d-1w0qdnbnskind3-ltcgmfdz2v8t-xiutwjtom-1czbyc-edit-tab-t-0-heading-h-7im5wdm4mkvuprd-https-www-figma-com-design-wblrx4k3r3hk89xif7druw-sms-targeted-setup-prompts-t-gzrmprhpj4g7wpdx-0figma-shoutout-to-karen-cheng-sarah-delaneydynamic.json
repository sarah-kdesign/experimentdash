  "title": ":sciencefair: _Released as experiment!_\n\n*Targeted Text Setup Prompts*\n\nThe Adoption team released the Targeted Text Setup Prompts feature on 2/9/26 to 50% of _paying accounts_ that _have not set up SMS_.\n\nThe goals of this feature are to increase the % of accounts that set up text messaging and improve the likelihood that those accounts are successful with the channel. Accounts that are exposed to this feature will be presented with a banner encouraging them to set up SMS on one of the following pages (see screenshots in :thread:):\n• Campaigns\n• Flows\n• Lists &amp; Segments\nWhat makes this feature different from typical banners is that we are taking a strategic and systematic approach to determining who sees a banner and when they see it. There are 2 layers of eligibility being checked:\n1. In order to be eligible for any of the banners, an account must meet criteria that demonstrates it has a healthy email foundation (e.g., account is &gt;= 30 days old, has a minimum number of live flows, has a live form, has a healthy campaign history).\n2. Once an account is eligible, they must meet product area-specific criteria in order to trigger the banner for that particular page (e.g., in order to see the banner on the Flows page, must have a live Welcome Series flow and a live Abandoned Cart flow)\n    a. Only one banner will be shown at any given time, based on the trigger(s) completed\n*Hypothesis*: Most email accounts are not ready to adopt text messaging very early in their lifecycle. Prompting too early creates friction and leads to unnecessary dismissals. Conversely, waiting too long misses high-intent moments that can meaningfully grow text adoption. We believe that targeted setup prompts based on account maturity and behavior will increase the rate of accounts setting up text messaging and increase the activation rates of those that set up\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1W0QDNBnSKind3_LtCGMfdZ2V8T-XIUtWjToM_1Czbyc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7im5wdm4mkvuPRD>\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/WBLRX4K3r3Hk89xIF7DRUW/SMS-targeted-setup-prompts?t=gzrMprHpJ4g7wpdx-0Figma>\n\nShoutout to @karen.cheng @sarah.delaneydynamic",
